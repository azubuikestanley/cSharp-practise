             Our Swap method will work only for integer parameter. If we want to use it for other types, for example, doubles or strings, 
             * we have to overload it for all the types we want to use it with. Beside a lot of code repetition, it becomes harder to 
             * manage the code because changes in one method mean changes to all of the overloaded methods.
             * Generics provide a flexible mechanism to define a generic type.
             * example line(12)
             
             static void Swap<T>(ref T a, ref T b)
             {
                T temp = a;

                b = temp;
             }
              
             In the above code, T is the name of our generic type, We can name it anything we want, but T is a commonly used name. Our Swap method
             * now takes two parameters of type T. We also use the T type for our temp variable that is used to swap the values.
             * 
             * Note the brackets in the syntax <T>, which re used to define a generic type.
             * We can now use our Swap method with different types, as in below and line(12)

            /*When calling a generic method, we need to specify the type it will work with by using brackets. So when Swap<int> is called, the T type
             * is replaced by int. For Swap<string>, T is replace by string.
             * If you omit specifying the type when calling a generic method, the compiler will use the type based on the arguments passed to the method
             * 
             * Mulitiple generic parameters can be used with a single method.
             * For example: Func<T, U> takes two different generic types.
